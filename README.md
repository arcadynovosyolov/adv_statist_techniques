Advanced statistical techniques

In this repository we present the following techniques:

1. Copula dependency modeling
2. Monte Carlo simulation
  - estimating probability of an event, (https://github.com/arcadynovosyolov/adv_statist_techniques/blob/master/monte_carlo/prob_event.ipynb)
  - Illustrating p-value distribution under true and false null hypothesis, (https://github.com/arcadynovosyolov/adv_statist_techniques/blob/master/monte_carlo/pvalue.ipynb)
3. Time series analysis (modeling and forecasting)
4. Non-parametric estimation, including kernel regression
5. Quantile regression
6. Bayesian inference
  - simple example of Bayesian inference, (https://github.com/arcadynovosyolov/adv_statist_techniques/blob/master/bayesian_analysis/simple_bayes.ipynb)
